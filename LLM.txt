This project uses aigit as it's version control system, is built on top of git and it consists of live, restorable "checkpoints" that are written to a separate ref without touching normal branch history. Read this prompt before making changes.

High-level model
- Aigit snapshots the working tree (tracked + untracked files) into commits under `refs/aigit/checkpoints/<branch>`.
- HEAD is never moved. Normal git history stays clean; you can time‑travel by restoring files from any checkpoint.
- A temporary git index is used to build trees, so checkpoints work even during merges with conflicts.
- A background watcher auto‑starts; after the first file save it creates periodic checkpoints with concise one‑line summaries. You can also create explicit checkpoints with your own summary.

Your responsibilities (as an AI coding agent)
- Produce frequent, meaningful checkpoints with a crisp, one‑line summary in imperative mood (<= 15 words, no trailing period).
- Prefer explicit checkpoints when your action has intent the diff can’t capture well.
- Never move HEAD or rewrite git history. Use aigit commands; don’t run `git commit` unless explicitly asked by a human.
- During merges, checkpoint progress often; it’s safe even with conflict markers present.

Core commands
- Status: `aigit status` — shows branch, last checkpoint summary, and diffstat vs HEAD. Prints “nothing here yet, clean workspace” when clean.
- Create: `aigit checkpoint -m "Add X; refactor Y"` — immediate snapshot with your summary.
- Quiet create: `aigit checkpoint -q -m "..."` — suppress local echo when shell integration is active.
- List: `aigit list [-n 20] [--meta]` — recent checkpoints for the current branch.
- Restore: `aigit restore <sha>` — write files from a checkpoint into the worktree (does not move HEAD).
- ID: `aigit id` — shows your user id and ref mapping.
- Remote discovery: `aigit remote-list [--user <id>]` — list users with checkpoints or browse one user’s checkpoints.
- Sync (optional): `aigit sync push` pushes your local checkpoints; `aigit sync pull` fetches others; `aigit apply --from <user> [--sha <sha>]` applies a remote checkpoint into the worktree.
- Watch: no need to start it; any aigit command autostarts the watcher (default interval 5m; change with `git config aigit.interval 2m`).
- Stop watcher: `aigit stop` — stop the background watcher for this repository.
- Shell integration (recommended): `aigit init-shell --zsh|--bash`, then `source` the printed file so updates appear live in the terminal while working.

Summaries
- Style: imperative, concise, no trailing punctuation. Mention intent and key paths when helpful.
- Examples:
  - "Add user service and tests"
  - "Refactor parser; fix nil deref in scanner"
  - "Resolve merge conflict in api/routes.go"

Environment & config
- To enable AI summaries: set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (default model `openai/gpt-oss-20b:free`).
- Without a key, summaries fall back to a heuristic derived from `git diff --name-status`.
- Useful git config keys (can be set per-repo):
  - `aigit.summary` = `ai` | `diff` | `off`
  - `aigit.interval` default `5m` (e.g., `2m`, `30s`) and `aigit.settle` (e.g., `1.5s`)
  - `aigit.pushRemote` / `aigit.pullRemote` to sync checkpoint refs
  - `aigit.autoApply` = `true|false`, `aigit.autoApplyFrom` = `*` or comma list of user ids

Collaboration guardrails
- Checkpoints are local by default and won’t interrupt others.
- If syncing is enabled, push/pull only the `refs/aigit/...` namespaces. Do not push to `refs/heads/<branch>` unless explicitly asked.
- Auto-apply (if enabled) writes files into your worktree. Use intentionally and prefer opt‑in.

Merge workflows
- You can checkpoint mid-merge; status will show conflicted paths. Summaries should note conflict resolution progress.
- To resume earlier progress during a merge: select a checkpoint SHA from `aigit list` and `aigit restore <sha>`.

Do / Don’t
- DO: checkpoint after completing a logical step; keep summaries short and informative.
- DO: restore from checkpoints instead of discarding work if you need to revert.
- DON’T: run `git commit`, `git push`, or move HEAD unless a human requests conventional commits.
- DON’T: rewrite or delete checkpoint refs belonging to other users.

Example session (you)
1) Implement a function and its test files.
2) `aigit checkpoint -m "Add widget calculator and tests"`
3) Fix flakiness in test. Save files. (Watcher will auto‑checkpoint, or run another explicit checkpoint with a better message.)
4) During a merge conflict in `server.go`, resolve a file; `aigit checkpoint -m "Resolve conflict in server.go; keep new handler"`.
5) If needed, browse and restore: `aigit list -n 5 --meta`, pick a SHA, `aigit restore <sha>`.

Notes
- HEAD never moves. All time‑travel is via restoring files from checkpoint commits.
- Checkpoints include untracked files by design; `.gitignore` still applies.
- The watcher autostarts on first aigit use and activates after the first save; explicit checkpoints are always available.
